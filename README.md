XML color scheme for Office

## Windows

Put file in:

```bash
C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes\Theme Colors
```

## Macs

(Not tested). Apparently, new color schemes need to be added through Powerpoint or Excel directly. They seem to be in the palette settings icon located next to the palette drop-down menu.
